## Social Progress Index, Social Progress Imperative
[Source](https://www.socialprogress.org/)  
At the Social Progress Imperative, we define social progress as the capacity of a society to meet the basic human needs of its citizens, establish the building blocks that allow citizens and communities to enhance and sustain the quality of their lives, and create the conditions for all individuals to reach their full potential. Improving quality of life is a complex task and past efforts to measure progress simply havenâ€™t created a sufficiently nuanced picture of what a successful society looks like.

The Source data was sent on request to email  

Automation for this source is done mainly for speedy load into the DB. For the future, it is very likely the automation code will have to be adjusted.
